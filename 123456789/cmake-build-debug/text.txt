The woman is Beautiful, the woman is Legendary, the woman is Great, the woman is a Goddess. A woman is the most beautiful and most mysterious creature in the universe. Without a woman, our world would be much more boring.
There are many Great men left in the history of mankind.zsThere is a lot of talk about them, monuments are erected to them, books are written about them, films are made. They are remembered, because they are, as it were, the standard of humanity.
But there were also Great women. Who have done no less for humanity than Great Men. But how few books have been written about them, how few monuments are erected to them, how few films are made.
And yet Great and Beautiful women have remained in the memory of mankind. And that's just fine.
